//1 Write a program that prints undefined when I print with its variable name?
//var a;
//var b = "Hello World!";
//console.log(a); // Output: undefined
//console.log(b); // Output: Hello World!

//2 What is the output of the following code?
//var n;
//console.log(n);

//What is the error in the following code?
//var x=3;
//console.log(X);
//output: ReferenceError: X is not defined 
//Because X is not defined here, JS is case sensitive so that's this x and this X is different
