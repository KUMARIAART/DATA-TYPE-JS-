//1 Write a program where a variable contains an object related to you with the properties
//of firstName, lastName, Phone Number, and isHealthy (true or false), and print it on console?
var myDetails={
    firstName:"AARTI",
    lastName:"KUMARI",
    phoneNumber:"123456789",
    isHealthy:true
}
console.log(myDetails);


//2 What is the output of the following code?
var obj1 = { a: 5, b: 6 };
obj1["a"] =7;
console.log(obj1)

//3 What is the error of the following code?
//var myObj = { name: "kumar", height: 5.4 };
//myObj[name] =7;
//console.log(myObj)
//Output:ReferenceError: name is not defined
//Because the name key we need to give it in strings as myObj["name"] =7;, otherwise it feels
//name as a variable and search for it to get value.
